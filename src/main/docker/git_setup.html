    <h1>Frinex GIT Configuration</h1>
    <p>The Frinex build service accepts experiment configuration files via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GIT</a> repositories. The repository cannot be accessed via a web browser, to access your assigned repository you will need to use a GIT client.</p>
    <p>There are many GIT clients to choose from, you can use the GIT command line application or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Git_GUIs">GIT GUI application</a> access your Frinex repository.</p>
    <p>One such tool is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code</a>, which has the advantage of providing an XML editor and a GIT client in the same tool. If you chose to use Visual Studio Code then you might also want to use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml">XML Language Support by Red Hat</a> extension. The XML extension will validate your XML but can also incorporate the Frinex documentation into that validation and provide help in the form of context based documentation and code completion.</p>
    <p>Whichever tool you choose to edit your XML you will want to ensure that the <a hred="/frinex.xsd">Frinex XSD</a> is correcty specified at the start of your XML document. You can find an example of this in the <a href="/minimal_example.xml">minimal_example.xml</a>. The XML documentation can also be viewed directly in the <a href="/frinex.html">Frinex Markup</a> document.</p>
